One of my notable contributions was the development and implementation of a Python Lambda function to streamline email communications. Additionally, I configured the Firebase SDK to enhance user authentication through MagicLink and crafted custom email templates. A significant achievement was the development of a responsive loader, complete with gameplay instructions, ensuring a seamless user experience on mobile devices. I also played a pivotal role in designing the Ristband landing page for the renowned SXSW festival. To ensure the project's success, I actively monitored errors using Sentry and maintained impeccable code quality with ESlint. My daily routine also involved task management through Jira and active participation in English daily meetings.\n\nMiniPCR (Shaping the Future of Education)\n\nFor the MiniPCR project, an educative platform, I led the FrontEnd development using the powerful NuxtJS framework. I was instrumental in implementing internationalization features using I18n and integrating Firebase authentication to secure user data. My role also involved setting up a myriad of tools, including ESlint, PostCSS, and nuxt/content, to name a few. I collaborated closely with the backend team, leveraging Axios for efficient data interactions. My design contributions included crafting interactive components for various activities and designing a fresh email template for MagicLink communications. Working in a team of five, our collaborative efforts were orchestrated through sprints managed in ClickUp.",

We recognized a gap in the market: a platform that seamlessly connects individuals wanting to rent out their vehicles with those in need of temporary transportation. Drawing parallels with Airbnb's model for accommodations, Kartz was meticulously crafted for the automobile rental domain.\n\nConceptualization & Planning\nCollaborating closely with my peers, we embarked on a journey to lay a solid foundation for Kartz. Our brainstorming sessions were intense, leading to the clear definition of the application's use cases, its overarching vision, and its mission. Every feature, every user interaction was planned with precision, ensuring that our end product would be both innovative and user-centric.\n\nDevelopment & Features\nAs the lead mobile developer, I took the helm of transforming our ideas into a tangible application. Using React Native CLI, I ensured that Kartz was not only functional but also user-friendly and optimized for various mobile devices. One of my significant contributions was the development of a feature that allowed users to list their vehicles, specify details, and set availability schedules. To foster trust within our platform, I also worked on transparency features, such as user reviews and rating systems, ensuring renters and owners could make informed decisions.\n\nRecognition & Achievements\nOur dedication and innovative approach didn't go unnoticed. Kartz proudly secured a position among the top 5 best projects at a contest organized by the prestigious Universidad de San Andr√©s (UdeSA). This recognition was a testament to our hard work, innovation, and the potential impact of Kartz in the car rental market.",
